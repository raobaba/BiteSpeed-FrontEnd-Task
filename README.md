Chatbot Flow Builder Documentation ================================== Overview -------- The Chatbot Flow Builder is a tool developed using React and React Flow, aimed at facilitating the creation of chatbot flows. It enables users to visually construct chatbot conversation flows by connecting different message nodes. The project is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for the addition of new node types and features in the future. Features -------- 1. \*\*Text Node\*\* \* Represents a message node in the chatbot flow, containing text content. \* Users can add multiple text nodes to the flow. \* Text nodes are draggable and can be connected to other nodes. 2. \*\*Nodes Panel\*\* \* Provides a panel for users to select and add different types of nodes to the flow. \* Currently, only text nodes are supported, but the architecture is designed to accommodate additional node types in the future. 3. \*\*Edge\*\* \* Represents the connection between two nodes in the flow. 4. \*\*Source Handle\*\* \* Origin point of an edge, located on a node. \* Each source handle can have only one outgoing edge. 5. \*\*Target Handle\*\* \* Endpoint of an edge, located on a node. \* Multiple incoming edges can connect to a target handle. 6. \*\*Settings Panel\*\* \* Appears when a node is selected, allowing users to modify the properties of the selected node. \* Currently supports editing the text content of text nodes. 7. \*\*Save Button\*\* \* Enables users to save the constructed flow. \* Performs validation to ensure the flow is valid, such as checking for empty target handles on nodes.

Component Breakdown ------------------- ### FlowBuilder.js Main component that contains the flow builder logic. ### NodesPanel.js Panel housing all available nodes for users to select and add to the flow. ### SettingsPanel.js Panel for editing node settings. Appears when a node is selected. ### TextNode.js Component representing a text node in the flow. ### SaveButton.js Button component for saving the constructed flow. Styling ------- The styling of the components is defined in the \*\*styles.css\*\* file, providing a consistent and visually appealing user interface. Extending the Flow Builder -------------------------- The project is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new node types and features. To add a new type of node: 1. Create a new node component (e.g., ImageNode.js). 2. Add the new node type to the nodeTypes object in FlowBuilder.js. 3. Update NodesPanel.js to include the new node type. Conclusion ---------- The Chatbot Flow Builder provides a user-friendly interface for constructing chatbot conversation flows. Its extensible architecture allows for future enhancements and customization to meet diverse user requirements.
